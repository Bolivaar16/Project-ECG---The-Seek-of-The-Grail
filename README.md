#Seek of the Grail
The cave was very quiet. This quiet felt worse than the loud screams of the dead. The Shadow Sickness had made all of Britain an empty place, full of moving dead bodies. Only a few people were safe, hiding below the ground. Inside, the great King Arthur was shaking and sick. He had a bite on his arm from one of the first "devourers." Now, his veins were black, and his eyes looked dead.

Merlin bent low. His face looked very sad. He had used all his magic, all the elf medicine, and every old spell he knew. Only one thing was left: a hope from an old story he helped write—the Holy Grail. It was the only thing that could clean the sickness from life.

"I must go alone," Merlin whispered to Guinevere, who was crying.

The walk to Camelot was full of scary things. The city was now a broken place, full of monsters. The old man, with his wood staff, walked through the ruined walls of the once-great castle. The moving dead were easy for the old wizard to beat, but he felt a heavy sadness for failing to save the King sooner.

That’s the way how the Seek of the Grial started.
